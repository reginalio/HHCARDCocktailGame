# 2015 HHCARD Cocktail Game (Android app) Readme

### Project Overview
This project comprised the HCARD (Human Centred Design of Assistive and Rehabilitation Devices) 
group project module at Imperial College London. 

Our group created a game designed to enhance rehabilitation experience for stroke patients.
By mimicking the arm motion required to make a cocktail, we hope to help recover hand and arm functions
of the patients via neuroplasticity. 

This repository contains the source code of the Android app written for the project. The app is to be used with 
2 physical cups we designed and an Arduino micro that receives commands from the phone via Bluetooth. 
The source code for the Arduino micro that the app interacts with can be found here: https://github.com/reginalio/HHCARD

The Bluetooth setup is taken from an open source project CxemCar1 (https://github.com/cxemnet/CxemCar1)

### Build
We used Android studio for this project (min sdk version: 15)
Code is tested on a Samsung phone running Android Kitkat 4.4.2
